# Language & Framework Insights in CyberWacht

**CyberWacht** empowers you with detailed insights into the programming languages and frameworks utilized across your repositories. This advanced feature provides a comprehensive analysis of the technologies employed in your projects, enabling a more focused and effective approach to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.

## Key Benefits

### Accurate Detection of Programming Languages

CyberWacht automatically detects the programming languages used in your codebase. This ensures that no language-specific vulnerabilities go unnoticed and helps you prioritize issues based on the technology stack in use.

### Framework Identification

Beyond programming languages, CyberWacht identifies the specific frameworks your applications rely on. Whether it's Django for Python, Spring for Java, or Express.js for Node.js, understanding these dependencies allows for a targeted security review tailored to your project’s ecosystem.

### Enhanced Security Analysis

By understanding the languages and frameworks in use, CyberWacht aligns its repository analysis with the unique security considerations of each technology. For example, it flags SQL injection risks in database-heavy frameworks or XSS vulnerabilities in frontend-heavy environments.

### Streamlined Vulnerability Management

CyberWacht pinpoints the areas of your code that require immediate attention by correlating detected technologies with known vulnerabilities. This prioritization ensures that your team focuses on the most critical threats, improving your application’s security posture efficiently.

### Developer Productivity Boost

With clear insights into the technologies in your repositories, CyberWacht allows developers to quickly understand the environment and make informed decisions about security updates, code refactoring, or adopting new frameworks.

## Use Cases

- **Compliance and Auditing:** Ensure your projects adhere to regulatory standards by understanding the frameworks and languages in use.
- **Technology Upgrades:** Assess the impact of upgrading languages or frameworks by visualizing their presence across projects.
- **Onboarding New Developers:** Simplify onboarding by providing a clear view of the technical landscape within your repositories.

By leveraging the **Language & Framework** insights in CyberWacht, your team gains the knowledge and tools needed to safeguard applications while maintaining a clear understanding of the underlying technologies.
