# Repository Security Features

### 1. Secrets Detection

- Secrets Detection on a Git repository involves scanning the codebase to identify sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or tokens, that may have been accidentally committed.

### 2. Licenses and SBOM

- Identifies and validates software licenses in dependencies to ensure compliance with legal and organizational policies. It provides a detailed inventory of software components, including versions, dependencies, and vulnerabilities, enabling transparency and security in the software supply chain.

### 3. Dependency Vulnerability Scanner

- A Dependency Vulnerability Scanner analyzes project dependencies to detect known security vulnerabilities, helping to identify and address potential security risks associated with third-party packages.

### 4. Languages and Framework

- Analyzes programming languages and frameworks to identify known vulnerabilities and ensure secure configurations, helping developers maintain secure coding practices and reduce the risk of exploits.
